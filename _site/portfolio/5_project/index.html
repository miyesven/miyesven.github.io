    <h2> FSGP 2017 </h2>

<p><br />
The Formula Sun Grand Prix annual competition is a track race where solar cars compete for the most number of laps over the duration of the competition (3 days). It attracts solar car teams from all over North America. A technical inspection is held first and only when the team meets all the necessary requirements, will the team be released to race on the track.
<br /><br />
As Mechanical Lead, I was responsible for vehicle integration and race preparation, ensuring that we can pass the preliminary technical inspection. Below is a list of projects I was involved in during the integration process:</p>

<h4> Mechanical Design Report: </h4>

<p><br />
The mechanical design report explains the design of the car for all major components and how the design complies with the competition regulations. Analysis is required for all fasteners and structural components to show a satisfactory safety factor. 
<br /><br />
My role:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Wrote a large portion of the Mechanical System Analysis and compiled all sections</li>
  <li> Used ANSYS to generate FEA simulations for structural components</li>
  <li> Generated most of the drawings from CAD</li>
  <li> Checked over all the calculations</li>
</ul>

<h4> Design and Fabrication: </h4>

      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Seat &amp; Seat Mould</td>
      <td>
        Chassis was small and not built according to regulations, so seat had to be custom designed to comply to the angles in the regulations. Modified member's design and was very involved in fabricating both the seat and the seat mould
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Wheel Adaptor</td>
      <td>Machined out a solid cylinder of aluminum and mates the sprocket with the wheel hub using the bandsaw, lathe and the mill.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Parking Brake Adapter</td>
      <td>Took an existing brake disc and machined an adaptor that allowed for proper mating with the driving pulley.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4> Modification: </h4>

  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Wheel Axles</td>
      <td>
        Current axle design made it impossible to put in the axle with both bearings in the wheel hub. Modified the design so that there will just be a sleeve in the center. I machined the new shafts and added castle nuts for each end of each axle.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Wheel Assembly</td>
      <td>
        Assembly in CAD did not account for the width of the head of the bolt, so I cut spacers and changed the length of the axle so that the wheel was effectively spaced out from the chassis.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Steering Assembly</td>
      <td>
        Steering angle was limited by walls of upright and thickness of rod end bearing. Oversaw grinding of the upright and installed adapters to increase the angle by ~10 degrees per side. 
        <br /><br />
        Steering column was too long so I remachined and outsourced welding and heat treatment rapidly.
      </td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Bottom Shell</td>
      <td>
        Taught members to do relief cuts for installing wheel and suspension assemblies. The original mounting points for the chassis were also too weak, so they had to be dremelled out and reinstalled.  
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br />
Overall, I oversaw the majority of the welding and managed the pre-competition bottomshell and chassis integration, including electrical integration with the mechanical interface. One of the main challenges was to prepare the car such that it was in compliance with competition regulations within our short timeline. Eventually, we were able to prepare the car such that it was close enough to completion for us to present it at competition.</p>
