    <p>The existing test fixture to test the ultimate torsional strength of half shafts does not have the necessary torque necessary to run the test. A gearbox was needed to increase the torque such that a safety margin could be attained at peak loads during the test. The new test fixture also had the additional capability to be Model 3/S/X compatible.</p>

Before starting on the design, I asked for quotes from various companies to verify the cost effectiveness of the project. Although we dont have the all the components necessary to product a quote for a custom gearbox, but I floated my ideas to some experienced engineers in the team and they gave me a generic quote from their previous experiences. The result was that the custom gearbox seemed to be a significantly better option than the two alternatives.</p>

<p><br />
Developed the relevant requirements and specifications for the gearbox below based on test requirements :

In the process, I have also considered using both spur gears and helical gears.</p>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="/img/planet_spur.png" alt="" title="spur gear concept" />
	<div class="col one"> Spur gears were too bulky for the torque load that was required. Helical gears were too expensive, plus the weight savings were not significant over the spur gear option.

</div>

<p><br />
A planetary gearset was the most ideal as this configuration:</p>
<ul>
	<li> Allowed for in-line operation with existing actuator </li>
	<li> Most compact and elegant packaging, easy to pickup and setup </li>
	<li> Allowed for the highest safety factors as contact and bending stresses are shared by the planet gear teeth </li>
</ul>

<p><br />
Below are the features of the gearbox:</p>
<ol>
	<li> Rapid Disassembly </li>
	<li> Easy Assembly </li>
	<li> Easy to mount on fixture </li>
	<li> More parts but smaller package than a spur gear configuration </li>
	<li> Bearings are fully preloaded </li>
	<li> Reduced cantilevered loads </li>
	<li> Shaft seals to keep grease in </li>
</ol>

<p><br />
Overall, I spent 2 months, with other projects on my radar, on developing, designing and producing engineering drawings for this project. Prior to the project, I spend about a week familiarising myself with CATIA’s features and product tree organisation. I knew I would be making several iterations of the design, so I was mindful of keeping the product tree neat and reasonably parametrized.
