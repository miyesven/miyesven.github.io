          <p class="display-6">Motor Mount</p>

          <p>
            <b>Problem:</b>
            <br/>
            The rear swing arm was two inches shorter than the model. Original motor mount did not allow for any pretension so no torque could be transmitted. 
            <br><br>
            <b>My role:</b>
            <ul>
              <li> Designed a new motor mount with specs from Gates </li>
              <li> Remade new Solidworks model of the rear swing arm within a day </li>
              <li> Purchased new belts and cut the new motor mount out of chromoly steel using the waterjet.</li>
            </ul>

            However, the model I made was still not accurate to the manufactured rear swing arm. With no time left, I ran back and forth between the waterjet cutter and the workspace to cut the new motor mount, determining dimensions experimentally. 
          <br><br>
            After 3-4 re-iterations, I found the dimensions of the motor mount that could work and mounted the motor with the belt just an hour before leaving for competition.

          <p class="display-6">Brake Pedal Redesign</p>
          <p>
            <b>Problem:</b>
            <br/>
            The original brake pedal was 10.5" in height but the height of the chassis only allowed at most 7.5". The pedal cannot be depressed past the center truss of the chassis. 
            <br/>
            The original brake pedal system we chose was a dual master cylinder floor mount assembly with a balancing bar (CNC 204 Model).
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Constraints</b>
            <ul> 
              <li>Maximising the pedal ratio without exceeding height limit</li>
              <li>Need to reuse parts of original brake pedal assembly (pistons, master cylinders, balancing bar)</li>
              <li>Cost Limitations</li>
              <li>Manufacturing ease and access to machines</li>
              <li>Limited time (~2 weeks to from start to finish)</li>
              <li>Ensure structural strength</li>
            </ul> 

            Overall, I used around a week to design and analyse the CAD model and order the materials for both the brake pedal and the brake pedal mount. Another week was used to finish manufacturing all the components. 

            <br><br>
            <b> Components manufactured </b>
            <ul>
              <li> Floor mount w/ pivot points</li>
              <li> Brake Pedal w/ precision bore for balancing bar</li>
              <li> Brake pedal mount on the chassis </li>
            </ul>

            The last week was outsourcing the aluminium welding, powder coating and heat treatment of all the welds. I machined the components using the waterjet cutter, the mill and the lathe. I also waterjetted a sheet of mild steel for the brake pedal mount then used the press brake and the grinder to bend and fit the mount. 
            <br/><br/>

          <p class="display-6">Canopy &amp; Egress System</p>
          <p>
            I oversaw the modification of the canopy to comply with the rollcage &amp; regulations, and the start to finish manufacturing process. The original plan was to thermalform the canopy from acrylic and we found that by making the canopy ourselves, we were able to reduce the cast from $10,000 to $2,000 while allowing members to gain experience with fabrication.

            <br/><br/>
            <b> My role: </b>
            <ul>
              <li> Oversaw the fabrication process of the canopy from start to finish</li>
              <li> Helped with making the mold in CATIA</li>
              <li> Bought materials -wood and foam- and machined the skeleton of the canopy</li>
              <li> Used hot wire to cut off excess foam to obtain curvature of canopy</li>
              <li> Coordinated buying of materials and organising manpower during various stages of fabrication</li>
            </ul>
                      
            I also designed the egress system- where the front half of the canopy hinged onto the topshell and swings open to enable the driver to jump out. The foot platform for the driver was designed by one of the members. I used the waterjet to cut the 
            profile and the sheet metal bender to bend to the right profile.

                    Steering column was too long so I remachined and outsourced welding and heat treatment rapidly.

            <h5> Overall Contribution </h5>
            <p>
              Overall, I oversaw the majority of the welding. I also managed the pre-competition bottomshell and Chassis integration. One of the main challenges was to prepare the car such that it was in compliance with competition regulations. I was also responsible in approving designs by members and all modifications to any part of the car. I was also in charge of purchasing of components, fasteners and securing of materials so that members could fabricate/assemble parts in time. 
              <br/><br/>
              Part of my responsibility also involved teaching the mechanical team to use power tools, as well as simple operations on heavy machinery such as waterjet cutters and mills. A more administrative aspect to my role is arranging tasks and framing projects for members while holding them accountable for deadlines.
