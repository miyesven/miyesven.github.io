          <h2>UBC Solar</h2>
          <h5> Mechanical Lead </h5>

          <p> 
            UBC Solar is an engineering design team dedicated to designing and fabricating highly efficient and aerodynamic racing solar cars that only run purely on solar power from scratch. We participated in the FSGP 2017 race this July for the first time and although we didn't manage to pass scrutineering, being able to talk to teams inspired us and has enabled us to start building a new car with renewed confidence.  
          </p>

          <p>
            I became the Mechanical Lead in March 2017 and was responsible for finishing up the car for competition. The journey to competition was complicated because we had to modify the car rapidly so that it would comply to competition regulations. The assembly was also a challenge as manufactured parts were not fully accurate to the model and most parts weren't designed with the actual assembly steps in mind. I worked on many separate projects, small and large, as well as organised the Mechanical Team according to an aggressive schedule.
          </p>

          <p>
            From September 2017 to FSGP 2019 (some time in July 2019), we are designing and building the second version of our car. I am leading both the Mechanical Team and the Aeroshell subteam (Aeroshell is the aerodynamic enclosure of the car). I also bear a certain amount of administrative responsibilities in terms of funding and management of the team.

          <h2>Engineering Physics Robot Competition</h2>
          <h5> Mechanical Lead </h5>
          <p> 
            The annual Engineering Physics (ENPH) Robot Competition is a competition for second year Engineering Physics students who spend 6 weeks in the summer designing and building a fully autonomous robot that can navigate mirror images of a course to complete a series of tasks to earn points for the team. In front of a lecture-hall packed audience, each group of 3-4 students pit their robots against other robots and compete for both points earned by rescuing "agents" and for completing the course in the least amount of time.

            Took on the main mechanical role in the team of four. Designed, built and integrated all the mechanical components and some of the electrical hardware from scratch.<br/>
            <ul>
              <li>Designed and fabricated the powertrain, which was used continuously throughout the competition without any maintenance necessary.</li>
              <li>Designed and fabricated the chassis assembly. The third and last iteration took 3 days from start of design to assembly of manufactured parts.</li>
              <li>Designed and fabricated a robust winching system to hoist the entire robot up the zipline (most teams opted to use lightweight baskets to complete the challenge)</li>
            </ul>
