<h2>Brake Pedal Redesign</h2>

<br/>
<h4>Problem</h4>

<br/>
The original brake pedal was 10.5" in height but the height of the chassis only allowed at most 7.5". The pedal cannot be depressed past the center truss of the chassis. 
<br/><br/>
The original brake pedal system we chose was a dual master cylinder floor mount assembly with a balancing bar (CNC 204 Model).
<br/>

<h4>Constraints</h4>

<ul> 
	<br/>
	<li>Maximising the pedal ratio without exceeding height limit</li>
	<li>Need to reuse parts of original brake pedal assembly (pistons, master cylinders, balancing bar)</li>
	<li>Cost Limitations</li>
	<li>Manufacturing ease and access to machines</li>
	<li>Limited time (~2 weeks to from start to finish)</li>
	<li>Ensure structural strength</li>
</ul>

		Motion analysis was done in CAD to make sure the chassis does not interfere with the full motion of the brake pedal
		<br/><br/>
		A simple prototype was fitted to the existing chassis with the intended driver at competition and checked for ergonomics and positioning.
		<br/><br/><br/>
	</span>

<div>
	Overall, I used around a week to design and analyse the CAD model in Solidworks and order the materials for both the brake pedal and the brake pedal mount. Another week was used to finish manufacturing all the components.

<h2>Canopy & Egress System</h2>

<br/>
<h4>Problem</h4>

<br/>
The old canopy made years ago was sitting in a shipping container and falling apart. A new one needed to be made in time for competition.
<br/><br/>
There was an additional challenge because the rollcage needed to be modified to comply with competition regulations and hence the previous canopy CAD model had to be remade. The short timeline to competition also posed a challenge as we had to find a way for the driver to egress the car.

<h4>My Role</h4>

<ul>
	<li> Oversaw the modification of the canopy to comply with rollcage and regulations 
		<ul>
			<li> Helped with making the mold CAD in CATIA </li>
			<li> Developed a manufacturing plan to reduce costs- from thermoforming the canopy from acrylic which costs $10,000, we were able to make our own canopy with only $2000 </li>
			<li> Waterjet cut the ribs that formed the shape of the mold </li>
			<li> Procured materials and helped shape the mold </li>
			<li> Organised manpower during various stages of fabrication </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li> Oversaw the development of the egress sytem of the canopy 
		<ul>
			<li> Cut out parts of the existing aeroshell to fit the canopy </li>
			<li> Designed hinge points and sectioned canopy so that front half swings away from driver </li>
			<li> Fabricated foot platform for driver to aid the driver in gaining height before jumping out during egress </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
