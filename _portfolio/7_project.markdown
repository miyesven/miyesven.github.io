<h3> Investigating Effectiveness of Canards as Roll Control Guidance system </h3>
<div class = "col two"> <p> For my 4th Year Capstone, I self-sponsored my capstone project. The sponsor was my design team, UBC Rocket. The project involve designing and building a test platform to empirically characterize prototype canard fin geometries. Canard fins are aerodynamic control surfaces, typically found near the nose of a rocket and provides active stabilization to the roll, pitch and yaw rotation orientations of the rocket.  </p> </div>
