<h3> Composite Nosecone </h3>

<br/>
 <h5>I led the design and fabrication of the quarter scale nosecone (half the diameter and half the height). Below describes the design and process. The nosecone was designed with a Von Karman curve due to the balanced behaviour over multiple mach regions in flight.</h5> 
<br/>

<div class="img_row">
  <img class = "col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/comp_cad.png" alt="" title=""/> 
  <div class = "col one">To the left is the Solidworks Model of the composite plug used to make the prototype nosecone. The vertical sections represent the supporting wooden ribs and foam sections. The plug was designed with a 2 degree draft relief angle and a flat

  <h3> Process (more info to come): </h3>
</div>

<div class = "img_row">
  <img class = "col half" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/comp_foam.JPG" alt="" title=" "/>
  <img class = "col half" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/comp_gelcoat.JPG" alt="" title=" "/>
</div>

<p> Assembled foam pieces and wooden support ribs, initially cut out the rough contours with a hot wire cutter. After laboriously epoxying, bonding, sanding, applying gelcoat then polishing, we get a smooth and shiny plug on the right with an approximate curve. </p>

<div class = "img_row">
  <img class = "col half" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/comp_fibreglass.JPG" alt="" title=" "/>
   <img class = "col half" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/comp_postpull.JPG" alt="" title=" "/>
</div>

<p> After polishing the plug, the composite mold was fabricated from a wet layup using fibreglass mat and cheap polyester resin. We were careful to use fibreglass weave for the first two layers so the contours were more accurately captured. The picture on the right shows the finished mold which came off nicely. </p>

<div class = "row">
  <img class = "col" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/comp_infusion.JPG" alt="" title=" "/>
  <p> One final step-- vaccum infusing the carbon fiber in the negative mold. We use vacuum infusion in an attempt to increase strength to weight ratio while being cost effective. Better than wet layup but not as good as prepreg</p>
</div>
<div class = "row">
  <img class = "col" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/comp_nosecone_outside.JPG" alt="" title=" "/>
  <p> Finally, half of one prototype nosecone comes out of the mold all shiny! Made of 4 layers of carbon fiber 45/45 weave. </p>

<h3> Recovery BodyTube (Airframe Section right below Nosecone) </h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="img_row">
  <div class = "col half"> To the right, is the CAD model of the current Recovery Bodytube Assembly. This construction is based on circular ribs, connected to three main thrust columns that run the length of this bodytube section. The three plates were designed by the recovery team to house the drogue and main parachutes separately. The material of choice is aluminum due to its high strength to weight ratio and its compatibility with many different types of fluids, including liquid oxygen (LOX). </div>

<h3> First Prototype : Stressed Skin Formation </h3>

<div class="img_row">
  <img class = "col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/pt_1_outside.JPG" alt="" title=""/>
  <img class = "col half" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/pt_1_inside_explanations.JPG" alt="" title=""/>
</div>
<div>
  <p> This is a stressed skin prototype that is reminiscent of the type of manufacturing typically found in aircrafts. It has a high stiffness to weight ratio, which is a desirable property for the rocket. However, due to the curved skin in the interface between the outer skin and the longitudinal struts, there is an undesirable gap between the two sheets being riveted together which can cause premature failure. </p>
</div>

<h3> Second Prototype : Curved Ribs Formation </h3>
<div class="img_row">
  <img class="col half" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/pt_cb_3.JPG" alt="" title=""/>
  <img class="coL half" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/pt_cb_4_explanations.JPG" alt="" title=""/>
</div>
<div>
   <p class = "caption"> I designed and made a channel bender assembly. Saved a valuable $300-700 by not buying a commercial unit that we would have to make our own custom dies as well. As can be seen on the right, a straight aluminum channel is easily rolled into a circular shape. Making the circular ribs has been the crux of manufacturing the circular ribs assembly design. After solving this problem, we moved into fabricating the three ribs and three columns and joining them together using conventional bolts. </p>
